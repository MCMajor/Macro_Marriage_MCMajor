This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
#install necessary packages and libraries 
install.packages(stringr)
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
```


```{r}
# Create framework to concatenate csv files
paste0("../Data/ss",01,"pak.csv")
```


```{r}
# Create integer atomic vector for sequence of years
Censusyears <- c(01:24)
Censusyears
```


```{r}
# pad vector with 0 to the left(default) to ensure all single digit files have a "0" to the left to ensure all files are called with no error
census_timeframes <- str_pad(Censusyears, width = 2, pad = "0")
census_timeframes
```


```{r}
# Create Variable for census csv files
# use map function to create a place holder for paste0 function for all integers of the vector to call all csv files for each year
census_person <- census_timeframes %>% map(\(x) read_csv(paste0("../data/ss",x,"pak.csv")))
census_person
```

```{r}
census_list <- census_person[1:24]
census_list
```


```{r}
merged_census <- census_person %>%
  reduce(full_join, by = "AGEP")
merged_census
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
